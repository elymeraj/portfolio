    "title": "About Me",
    "text": "My name is Eldis Ymeraj and I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence and Human Factors at the University of Caen Normandy. My studies allow me to develop strong skills in artificial intelligence and data science, while also keeping an openness to human sciences such as psychology and neuroscience.\n\nI am open to different internship opportunities, especially in the fields of data, machine learning or applied artificial intelligence, whether in research, industry or technological innovation.\n\nOutside of my studies, I am passionate about sports and I regularly go to the gym. I also enjoy reading, especially scientific, historical and political books, which broaden my vision of the world. Finally, I love traveling and discovering new cultures, which keeps me curious and open-minded.\n\nI consider myself a motivated, curious and ambitious person, always ready to learn and take on new challenges."
